# Malkia
Help the girl Child

Malkia is a tool that aids in the fight against FGM. It serves as a reporting tool where users can submit FGM sightings and the app is able to map this information using the Google Maps API. Once mapped the information is accessed via a dashboard that verified NGOs in the fight can access in order to plan properly and get real-time data.

It also serves as support system for victims where they are able to engage with the app and help in the fight. Not just victims but any individual out there who wants to help in the fight against FGM.

Some of the features:
1. A chatbot that has FGM related data using google dialogflow
2. Google Mapping tool
3. Firebase Implementated (For realtime data processing)

The app is a team effort and was an amazing experience working on at the KNATCOM/UNESCO Sustainable Mobile Apps Workshop where we were grouped and tasked to come up with prototypes for apps that would solve any of the 17 SDGs. The group members are:

1. <a href="https://github.com/malcolmmaima">Malcolm Maima</a>
2. <a href="https://github.com/dezma">Desmond Maina</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/SaidKitty">Said Kiti</a>
4. <a href="https://github.com/chriskaburu">Chris Kaburu</a>
5. <a href="https://github.com/UshieYvette">Ushie Yvette</a> 

We came in second and new friendships were formed. At the moment this is just a prototype and is open to further development.

Once you've signed up for an account your details are stored in the firebase DB and you can now login. Build the app and have a go at it *wink wink* )

Inbuilt chatbot using the google DiagFlow. This chatbot is fed with FGM related topics and help information that way the user can engage with the app constantly.
</p>

<h2>Report Location</h2>
<p>
  The user can report the FGM sighting using the mapping tool powered by Google Maps. This can pick your current location if you're at the site of the FGM ceremony or enter location if you're at remote area far from the FGM sighting. 
  
  (Concept): Once the GPS co-ordinates have been captured they are sent to our Firebase DB that way our dashboard will be able to access the latitude / longitude points and map it into a nice dashboard UI.
